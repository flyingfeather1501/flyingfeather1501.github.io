[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flyingfeather1501/flyingfeather1501.github.io.svg?branch=source)](https://travis-ci.org/flyingfeather1501/flyingfeather1501.github.io)

My personal website, built on [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog) and [Pollen](https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen).

## Build requirements

- Racket
- threading-lib `raco pkg install threading`
- Pollen `raco pkg install pollen`
- Frog `raco pkg install frog`

- Bash. The site is largely duct taped together in `build.sh`.
