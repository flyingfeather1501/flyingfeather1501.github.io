## Pages vs. Blog posts

A blog post has a date and is kind of like a public diary.

An individual page should be a standalone document (ie. [a concept note](https://www.orgroam.com/manual/A-Brief-Introduction-to-the-Zettelkasten-Method.html)); it should be also be a document that will [obviously not fit on Wikipedia](https://www.gwern.net/Wikipedia-and-Other-Wikis).
