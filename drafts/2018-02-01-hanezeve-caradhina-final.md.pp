After putting this aside for three months, I finally spent another few minutes thinking what the last line can mean.

◊quotation{
Holo-ohlo holo forðe holo	The Abyss has invited us
Helelele lelele						*come*
colwelela kalalila				let the journey begin
Hanezeve yulumai-ni				to the bottom of the Abyss
}

Let's just say "holo" is the modifier form of the Abyss, kind of as a holy figure…
Taking "forðe" as something like English "for the", I can make it so it means "toward". (I'm spelling it as "forðe" to differenciate it from English, but now it seems taking the English meaning is actually possible.)

cara-dhina: in-deep
forðe-holo: toward-abyss(modifier)

Holo-ohlo: holy/abyss(modifier)-invite
holo (pronoun): "it" (holy form, like "祂" in Mandarin)
forðe-holo: toward-abyss/holy/it(modifier)

Helelele lelele: some sort of sound-mimicking phrase? Maybe kind of like ドキドキ(dokidoki), わくわく, etc. in Japanese? Like how ドキドキ can be translated to "My heart is pounding", maybe this can be translated to "“Come, come”". (yes, double quotation.)
◊quotation{
A.
I am dreaming a dream
to explore even deeper
the treasures, the wonder
Deep in the Abyss

B.
*It* invites us towards itself
"Come, come"
Let the journey begin
to the bottom of the Abyss
}
