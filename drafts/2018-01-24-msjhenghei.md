Part 2. Plot twist: Microsoft Jhenghei, Microsoft Yahei, Meiryo, and (the korean cjk font) aren't even matching fonts. Mixing Jhenghei, Yahei and Meiryo looks about as horrible as MingLiU, Simsun, and MS Gothic. They. Don't. Bloody. Match.

MS Jhenghei is itself a weird UI font. It is way too thin for that. Yahei and Meiryo aren't as bad but again, they don't go along with each other.
