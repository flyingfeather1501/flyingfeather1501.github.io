The premise is the first thing people look at when seeing if they want to watch a show. This premise can be provided by its title, the description of it, or the first seconds of the series. It establishes people's expectations with the show. This makes writing the description of a show an incredibly important task: you're setting up people's expectations, if it's done wrong, you'll ruin it.

As an example, Re:Zero should be described as:
    A high school shut in, Subaru, was teleported into a new world. There he gets beaten, but was saved by a silver-haired girl who called herself "Satella". As a return, Subaru offers to help Satella help her lost badge. When they've traced down where the badge could've gone, an enemy appears, then immediately slaughtered them...
