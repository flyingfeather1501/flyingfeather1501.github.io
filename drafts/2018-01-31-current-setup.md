keymap concept, made with xmodmap and function keys
osu.xmodmap:
â—Šhighlight['xmodmap]{
! keymap for osu on a keypad
keycode 80 = KP_Up F31 KP_Up F31
keycode 79 = KP_Home F32 KP_Home F32
keycode 83 = KP_Left F33 KP_Left F33
keycode 84 = KP_Begin F34 KP_Begin F34
! f34 is bound to hold grave for a second in openbox config
}

Super-o: osu! keymap
Super-Shift-o: default keymap

openbox, xdotools, xmodmap, plasma, all mangled together.
Media keys are openbox shortcuts that run xdotool, which are picked up by plasma and does whatever.
osu keymap is a openbox shortcut that runs xmodmap to bind keypad to function keys (specifically F31-34), which are picked up by openbox to run xdotool.
