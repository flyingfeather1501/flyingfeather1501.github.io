Windows CJK font rant, part 1.

PMingLiU. Simsun. MS Gothic. The old Microsoft Windows default CJK fonts.

If you use Windows and open a web page with Han characters in it, you might notice the font looks kind of out of place.

That's PMingLiU. A font from the 1990s. A font that goes bitmap on your 2010s 4k monitors. A font that isn't even rendered with smooth edges. A font as camcerous as Comic Sans, even worse: it's the default fallback font.

And it has to pair up with MS Gothic and Simsun: two fonts with the same problems, but don't even look like they're in the same family.

Microsoft Jhenghei, Yahei, Meiryo, and (Windows new Korean font) are supposed to be the fix for this CJK font problem, but they are not. They're about as bad, they aren't quite compatible enough with the old family to fully replace them, and they aren't even a good font family either.

That'll be part 2.
