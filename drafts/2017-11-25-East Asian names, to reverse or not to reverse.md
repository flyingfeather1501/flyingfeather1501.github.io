    Title: East Asian names, to reorder or not to reorder?

In English, some people write East Asian names with given name first, surname last (like "Kei Asai"). I personally dislike doing this, because names are whole word objects that shouldn't be reordered. To stay accurate with the source when translating, I prefer to simply transliterate, ◊ie romanize.

Me being born in Taiwan using Mandarin as my primary language probably contributes to this preference. Knowing the original name, then seeing it reversed in an English document throws me off quite a bit. Not to mention the fact that there are infinitely more different name formats out there, not just the English "First Middle Last" or the East Asian "Surname-Given_name".

There's an exception to this: when the person / character already has an English name, I will use that instead.

So, in my opinion, a name should always be translated by its sound unless otherwise specified.

Here is a table of some Japanese and Chinese names, how they would be translated with surname kept last, and how I would translate them.

| East Asian name | My Preference | "Reordered" |
---------------------------
| 王小明 | Wang Xiaoming | Xiaoming Wang |
| 一宮エルナ | Ichimiya Eruna | Eruna Ichimiya |
| 郭台銘 | Terry Guo | Terry Guo |
| 春埼美空 | Haruki Misora | Misora Haruki |
