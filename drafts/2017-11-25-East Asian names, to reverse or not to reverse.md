    Title: East Asian names, to reorder or not to reorder?

In English, some people write East Asian names with given name first, surname last (like "Kei Asai"). I personally dislike doing this, because names are whole word objects that shouldn't be reordered. To stay accurate with the source when translating, I prefer to simply transliterate, ◊ie romanize.

There's an exception to this: when the person / character already has an English name, I will use that instead.

Here is a table of some Japanese and Chinese names, how I would translate them into English, and how they would be translated with surname kept last.

| East Asian name | My Preference | "Reordered" |
---------------------------
| 王小明 | Wang Xiaoming | Xiaoming Wang |
| 一宮エルナ | Ichimiya Eruna | Eruna Ichimiya |
| 郭台銘 | Terry Guo | Terry Guo |
| 春埼美空 | Haruki Misora | Misora Haruki |
