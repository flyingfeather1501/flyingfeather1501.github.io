    Title: East Asian names, to reorder or not to reorder?

In English, some people write East Asian names with given name first, surname last (like "Kei Asai"). I personally dislike doing this.

"Surname last, given name first" is a culture-specific usage. I see names as whole word objects, and shouldn't be reordered for the sake of fitting into "native" arrangements.

As I read a name as a whole word object, when I see it treated as two or more words and rearranged, I feel unnatural. To stay accurate with the source when translating, I prefer to simply transliterate, â—Šie romanize.
