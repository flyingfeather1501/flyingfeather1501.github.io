There are two general types of what would look like "time travel". One reconstructs space, another actually jumps through time.

The type that reconstructs time is like loads in games. Time moves forward as usual, but current world state is discarded, then reconstructed from a previously saved state. Example: Sakurada Reset (current world state is discarded except what higher ranked abilities have preserved), Re:Zero (1-slot autosave + autoload, with Subaru's memory preserved).

The other one is actually time travel. Some stories jump to different timelines (e.g. S;G), some jump on the same timeline but with extra information stored elsewhere (e.g. Clannad, Re:Zero).
