*DDDDRRRRAAAAFFFFTTTT*

"Yandere" is a sort of personality trait commonly used to describe characters in fiction. It originated from the Japanese words "◊R["病"]{や}んでる", meaning sickening, and "デレデレ", a word describing being in love with someone. Its definition mostly comes down to "sickened love".

I categorize yandere into two types, one with the insanity directed towards themself, the other towards their affection, or those around their affection.

## DDLC
Act 2 Yuri is of the first type, doing sickened things to herself, while Monica is the second, hurting and (indirectly?) killing others for her own goal.

## Higurashi
Haven't finished yet.

## Mirai Nikki
Gasai Yuno is type 2, killing others in name of protecting her affection.

## Momokuri
Here's an example of two yandere candidates getting together. Just imagine if Momotsuki denied Kurihara. (??)

## (those two yandere books)
