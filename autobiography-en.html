    <h2 id="g4896">1. Past.</h2><p>I’m Kevin Shen, or Kisaragi Hiu, a 17-year-old third-grader in <a href="http://www.slhs.tp.edu.tw/" target="_blank" class="">Shilin High School of Commerce</a>.</p><p>I was born on February 28, 2000. According to my parents, I actually started memorizing the English alphabet before learning Bopomofo—just a trivia, not really an indicator for any sort of English skills.</p><p>My parents sent me to a dual-language kindergarten when I was 3, where I received most of my early English education. Later the kindergarten course extended into elementary school, further driving most of my English learning of the period.</p><h3 id="g4897">1.1. Elementary school</h3><p>I attended <a href="http://www.tzes.tp.edu.tw/" target="_blank" class="">Taipei Municipal Da Zhi Elementary School</a> for my primary education. During this time, I spent most of my time getting good grades, and occasionally play a few video games. I was also very active, playing tag with friends every break between classes.</p><p>During grade 6, my class participated in the Taipei City Elementary School Sports Contest (台北市小學運動會) and got third place in relay. (<a href="http://www.tzes.tp.edu.tw/news/u_news_v2.asp?id={FB2A7A2C-1C2E-345E-CD1E-7282D247C435}&amp;newsid=3480&amp;PageNo=45&amp;skeyword=" target="_blank" class="">Announcement from TZES on 2012/03/07.</a>) I was a backup runner, and practiced with the team, though I wasn’t running fast enough to join the final race.</p><p>I graduated in June 2012.</p><div class="page-break"></div><h3 id="g4898">1.2. Junier high</h3><p>I joined <a href="https://web.dcsh.tp.edu.tw/" target="_blank" class="">“Da Zhi High School”</a> in September.<br/>During grade 7, I started having an interest in installing custom ROMs on my Android phone, which grew into an interest in Linux a few months later. I started my Linux journey with Ubuntu, installing it on an unused computer at home, and learned a lot more about computers when using it. Around March 2013, I also started reading books on the writer <a href="http://seba.tw" target="_blank" class="">Seba’s blog</a>, and I still read quite a lot to this day. I also played Minecraft for a bit, at one point trying (and failing) to create a custom game map in it.</p><p>Fun trivia, my main email <code>kevinshencm10@gmail.com</code> was created during this period when I successfully installed CyanogenMod 10 on my Xperia Arc S for the first time.</p><p>I got a laptop from my family in October 2013, and immediately installed <a href="https://elementary.io/" target="_blank" class="">elementary OS</a> on it. After that was my time of rapid Linux exploration.</p><p>I got into <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/home" target="_blank" class="">osu!</a> in February 2014, and have been playing since.</p><p>I started a niconico account around April 2013, and got hooked onto the indie music scene on the platform. As a result, I got really interested in Japanese, and told myself to try to learn Japanese in four years, as an experiment to see how far I can go. It has been going really well: without taking any actual courses, I think I’m at about JLPT N3 level, able to read less complicated novels and comics like <a href="https://www.no-ichigo.jp/read/book/book_id/1393204" target="_blank" class="">星の涙</a>.</p><p>In grade 9, I started learning a vocal synthesizer platform called <a href="http://utau2008.web.fc2.com/" target="_blank" class="">UTAU</a>, and covered a few songs with it. I also started learning <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank" class="">Blender</a> around April 2014, and have finished a few renders with it.</p><p>I publish my covers on <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCl_hsqcvdX0XdgBimRQ6R3A" target="_blank" class="">Youtubeyoutube</a> and <a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/user/38995186" target="_blank" class="">niconiconiconico</a>, and my renders, sketches, etc. on <a href="https://pixiv.net/member.php?id=14235181" target="_blank" class="">Pixivpixiv</a>.</p><div class="page-break"></div><h3 id="g4899">1.3. Senior high</h3><p>I joined <a href="http://www.slhs.tp.edu.tw/" target="_blank" class="">Shilin High School of Commerce</a> in 2015, majoring in the Applied Foreign Language (English) department, with the goal of advancing my English skills.</p><p>I’ve translated a few projects in senior high so far. I am the main (only, actually) Chinese (Taiwan) translator for <a href="https://easyrpg.org/" target="_blank" class="">EasyRPG Player</a>, as you can see on <a href="https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/FlyingFeather" target="_blank" class="">my Transifex profile</a>, and one of the three Traditional Chinese translators for <a href="https://github.com/naseweis520/osu-Sync" target="_blank" class="">osu!Sync</a>, a tool for managing <a href="http://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Beatmaps" target="_blank" class="">osu! beatmapsosuwiki</a>.</p><p>In July 2016, I started looking into programming, and made a Bash script called <a href="https://github.com/flyingfeather1501/randomwallpaper" target="_blank" class="">randomwallpaper</a> for slideshow wallpaper on some desktops that don’t support it. I have since then written a few small shell utilities to automate my life a little bit better, like <code>markdown-furigana</code> which is a quick hack to replace all occurrences of <code>{{text:ruby}}</code> with html tags for <ruby>ruby<rt>this</rt></ruby>.</p><p>All this time I’ve been playing <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/home" target="_blank" class="">osu!</a> once in a while, but in March 2017 I decided to practice it a bit more as well to learn more about this process. I also want to create a <a href="http://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Skin" target="_blank" class="">osu! skinosuwiki</a>, so after a few months of work, I now have a hacked-together osu! skin builder, <a href="https://github.com/flyingfeather1501/mkosuskin.sh" target="_blank" class="">mkosuskin.sh</a>, for turning a bunch of Blender, LMMS, and Inkscape project files into a zip file that osu! accepts as a skin.</p><p>After thinking about it since when I was 11 or so, I started practicing singing in February 2017. I have now practiced and even uploaded a few covers onto my youtube channel (though they’re very rough around the edges). Currently I plan to join the school singing competetion in September and see how it goes.</p><div class="page-break"></div><h2 id="g4900">2. Present.</h2><p>Right now, I have the ability to:<br/>･Translate English ↔ Mandarin, Japanese → English<br/>･Do basic programming (<a href="https://github.com/flyingfeather1501" target="_blank" class="">See for yourself.</a>)<br/>･Blender</p><div class="page-break"></div><h2 id="g4901">3. Future.</h2><p>My dream is to be a freelancer, in full control of my financial situation, and have a sustainable income. In order to achieve that, some actual skills are definitely needed, and that’s what I’m currently doing.</p><p>In addition to that, I also want to be an artist.</p><p>I want to be able to sing well. I want to be producing stories. I want to create astonishing virtual environments. I want to be able to read in as many languages I feel like learning. I want to be a programmer, solving people’s problems. I want to be able to jump around fields as I will.</p><p>First step to that is definitely learning the skills, and learning “learning” itself. I have to optimize my learning process. If I learn something, I want to actually understand what’s going on to some degree.</p><p>After that, it’ll be about mixing my skills to create my own future. That’s also meaning I put into the name Kisaragi Hiu: <code>“To shine like the Moon, to fly like a feather.”</code></p><h2 id="g4902">4.
