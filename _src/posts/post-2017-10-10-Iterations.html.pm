Learning is based on iterations. Do something, then repeat, then repeat until you're familiar with it, is essentially the process; people call this "practice".

Different subjects have different sorts of steps to repeat, for instance:

◊dl{
◊dt{Language learning}
◊dd{◊ol{
    ◊li{Find a unit of text (eg. a sentence).}
    ◊li{Figure out what it means.}
    ◊li{Repeat.}
    }
}
◊dt{Piano}
◊dd{◊ol{
    ◊li{Find an unfamiliar sheet.}
    ◊li{Divide it into smaller chunks.}
    ◊li{Play each chunk until some level of familiarity.}
    ◊li{Combine them together.}
    ◊li{Repeat.}
    }
}}

Learning is essentially finding the steps of an iteration, and then doing it again and again.
