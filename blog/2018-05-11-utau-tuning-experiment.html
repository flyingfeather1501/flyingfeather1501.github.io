        <root><p>Back in March, I started getting back into doing UTAU covers, and have tried to finish one cover within two weeks. I&rsquo;m so far happy with the results, although it is taking up too much of my attention.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve done this sort of experimental “metaprojects” in the past, where I try to put more effort into a specific subject. Last March I tried to get better at osu! which has so far turned out ok (I&rsquo;m at least actually improving), and I tried to practice singing last year, releasing several covers with my own voice.</p><p>The singing experiment last year ended pretty much as a failure, with only six covers released overall (so it wasn&rsquo;t even frequent), and my voice never improved during that time. I realized that I need to practice my voice, and that I do not have an environment that I&rsquo;m comfortable to practice in. I decided to put it aside for now (I can pick it up in the future with more effort, if I want), and focus somewhere else instead.</p><p>So starting with <a href="https://youtu.be/npl4XY7CwK4">my cover of SHIRO</a> in March, I started finding more songs to cover and trying out Yamine Renri&rsquo;s variants. While covering SHIRO, I tried to utilize Moresampler&rsquo;s flags (specifically <code>Mt</code>), which turned out pretty decent. With the next cover, <a href="https://youtu.be/DpOt7wi-P7E">This Earth, for You ft. Yamine Renri</a>, I tried to put as much emotion into it as I can, utilizing Renri&rsquo;s variants and Moresampler&rsquo;s flags together, and I think it turned out alright. One big issue was my use of breath sounds — this cover was actually the first time I attached breath-in sounds to a cover, and I kind of screwed that up by making them too audible.</p><p>The thing is, the This Earth, for You cover was done within 2 weeks, a time I previously thought incredibly hard to achieve for an UTAU cover. My past covers always took somewhere between a month and close to a year, and I hadn&rsquo;t tried to, well, actually work on a project throughout an entire week. I had always worked on them for a few hours, and let them sit there for weeks. The covers I&rsquo;ve done this year have all taken less than 2 weeks, yet to some degree good enough (to let me improve) for me.</p><p>So I think this UTAU covering experiment is successful so far. I still have plenty of things I want to learn, like actually composing my own songs and drawing, so putting all my efforts into releasing an UTAU cover every two weeks isn&rsquo;t the best choice for me, but so far I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it.</p></root>
