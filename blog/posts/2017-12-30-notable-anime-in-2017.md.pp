2017 is the second year since I started following seasonal anime. (I started with Re:0 last summer.)

There have been a few series that I liked this year, and this is the list.

◊series{Saga of Tanya the Evil (Youjo Senki)} This is actually a story about an alternative version of World War I in a world with semi-magical powers.

When this series aired, I thought this is just another loli series that kind of just screws around. Then a few months after the broadcast, I decided to pick up this series after watching a review of it (and being spoiled) on Youtube. It was actually quite nice.

I wish I could see its actual ending though. That's the problem with adaptations…

◊series{Sakurada Reset} I love this series. Maybe it's because how I *somehow* relate to Haruki, maybe it's the English version that sucked… Fight me.

This is a story taking place in a superpower-filled town, about solving the mysteries two of the main cast face.

It's adapted into a movie (series) and an anime at the same time, but I've heard that the movie was heavily abridged… They really should have put the budget into the anime instead of the movie.

I do agree the animation leaves a lot to be desired though. There are way too many still frames, even when they could have at least added a little bit of wind or camera movements.

◊series{Sukasuka} The *stomach aching* series of Spring 2017.

◊series{Made in Abyss}

◊series{Fukumenkei Noise}

◊series{Konosuba S2}

◊series{Kino's Journey}

◊series{Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou} Interesting to see the 

◊series{Houseki no Kuni} Huh, a full 3dcg series! Let's see… → WTF this is *really* good.

A genderless society (of about 30 people)! Yay!

◊series{Just Because} The relationships actually don't feel too lame or forced into a story.
