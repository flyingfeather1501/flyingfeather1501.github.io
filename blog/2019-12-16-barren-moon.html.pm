I started writing poems (mostly in Mandarin) intermittently in 2013. Initially I put them on Blogger; I then moved them into this site in 2017. However, since they were quite different from everything else on this site (not to mention in a different language), and since I don't really have a category / tag system that works well, I effectively removed all mentions to them on this site. They were still hosted here, but there were no links in any of the main pages.

Last week I finally got around to doing something about it. I've packaged them into a poem collection at ◊link["https://barren-moon.kisaragi-hiu.com"], although it's still Mandarin only.

The book is built with Pollen, presented with CSS Grid, with styles inspired by ◊link["https://practicaltypography.com"]{Practical Typography} (specifically the link styles). It should look fine on most screen sizes, and I plan to make a PDF version to sell on ◊link["https://booth.pm"]{Booth}.
