I'm currently making a new cover using UTAU, after having broken the last streak of covers. This time, I thought I'd try using â—Šcommand{make} to help with rendering.

My biggest obstacle is automating the rendering itself: I don't know if UTAU has a command line interface, and using â—Šcommand{xdotool} proved to be too unreliable when I tried. (It was frustrating.)

â—Štweet["https://twitter.com/flyin1501/status/1116410591747305472"
       #:summary "How do I render a UST from the command lineâ€¦"
       #:author "å¦‚æœˆé£›ç¾½ðŸŒˆ"
       #:profile "flyin1501"
       #:date "2019å¹´4æœˆ11æ—¥"]

As it turned out, automating the rest of the rendering process is still really helpful. Here is the Makefile for UTAU projectsâ—Šref[]:

â—Šhighlight['make]{
UTAU = env WINEPREFIX=/home/kisaragi-hiu/.wineprefix/UTAU wine "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\UTAU\\utau.exe"
WAV = $(patsubst %.ust,%.wav,$(wildcard *.ust))

render: $(WAV)
.PHONY: render

$(WAV): %.wav: %.ust
	$(UTAU) "$(realpath $<)"
}

Which simply runs â—Šcode{$(UTAU) <ust full path>} for each UST that's newer than its corresponding output file. The caveat here is that the UST needs to share its name with its output, which has to be set manually.

Now when I run â—Šcode{make render}, UTAU windows will pop up one by one for me to manually do the renderâ—Šref[""]. This may not be quite automatic, but it's at least better than manually opening every UST in the project and rendering them.
