The green signal lights up
As the overpass overlooks us
Everyone has moved on
As the signal turns red

Let's go through the underpass

Maybe someone's on the overpass
Maybe you're on the overpass
I can't know anyways
I'm on a different route after all

Everything goes its own route
The eagle and the peng
I've drifted off, while you're on the ground
Without destination, the feather I am

Coming out from the underpass
Looking back at the crossing
There's only a crowd, without you
