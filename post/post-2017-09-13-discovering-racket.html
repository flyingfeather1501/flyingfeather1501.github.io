    <p>In around March this year, I started trying to make my own osu! skin, or at least mix a skin for my own use.<br/>I started with the <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/454986">Emilia (Re:0) skin by Beatstatic</a>, with a git repo to track my changes, and copied the hitcircles from <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/300001">Clear Skin Ultra 2.4</a> (I like its hitcircle design a lot).</p><p>Then I stumbled across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yih6pz09Z1A">a font made for the I script in Re:0</a> in April, and started wanting to learn the script for the sake of it. As part of the practice, I decided why not make osu!‘s elements in the Re:0 writing system? So I made a new folder in my mix skin, then opened Blender to make the elements, because that’s the only tool I was comfortable with using. (I’ve since learned to use Inkscape more.)</p><p>Making osu! skin elements with Blender is weird. I am putting multiple elements in the same file and adding a different camera for each of them, binding the cameras onto markers, and so I wondered if there’s some way to render every marker and maybe name the output with the marker.<br/>After a bit of Googling, I saw an answer by `p2or` on StackExchange that fits my needs perfectly. (I added the first two comments.)</p><div class="highlight"><table class="sourcetable"><tbody><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre> 1

Blender also only allows one resolution per scene, so I had to write some post processing functions that resize some images for me, as well as a sort of interface to them through the file names.</p><p>Later in June, I decided to also cover the hitcircles and other elements, and eventually removed all assets not made by me. I also purged all of those out of the git repository; in hindsight, I actually regret that a bit. While refactoring that, I also wanted to do something about the ugly shell script, and I started looking around for different languages.</p><p>I thought about <a href="http://xon.sh/">Xonsh</a>, Python, <a href="https://scsh.net/">`scsh`</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/michaelmacinnis/oh">`oh`</a> shell, and some others, but:</p><ul><li>`oh`: I don’t really understand. At least not yet.</li><li>Python: I don’t like doing shell script-y stuff in Python currently. Previously I had ported my `randomwallpaper` script to Python, and it didn’t feel better than Bash. This is purely my issue.</li><li>Xonsh: Looks very interesting, but I got stuck trying to figure out how I should parse command line arguments.</li><li>`scsh`: A full language + some shell-isms, sort of like Xonsh. Project feels kind of inactive though.</li></ul><p>So I just gave up and stayed with Bash, and tried to improve the script further; but the “Scheme shell” idea seemed really interesting to me, so I decided to Google for “Scheme shell” and see what I’d get. Racket showed up in the results, and I met Racket for the first time. It actually looks great!</p><p>From there I started with the <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html">Quick Intro</a> by Matthew Flatt, and am now trying to learn Racket. Along the way I have seen Pollen, and wrote a self introduction for school in it; and Frog, which I now build this blog with. I’m still very new—I’m not exactly trying hard on anything—but I have definitely stumbled across a very powerful tool.</p><p>About the osu! skin, it’s now released as <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/630525/start=0">Retome (currently 0.4)</a> on the osu! forum.</p>
