* Partials

Templates that can be used in other templates.

** Passing the environment to the partial

#+begin_src web
{{ partial "partial-name" . }}
#+end_src

The object referenced by =.= becomes the root object inside the partial.

** Passing more than one argument

You can use the scratch feature.

When calling (where =mypartial= is the name of the partial below):

#+begin_src web
{{ .Scratch.Set "noyear" false }}
{{ partial "mypartial" . }}
#+end_src

In the partial:

#+begin_src web
{{ if $.Scratch.Get "noyear" }}
    {{ .Format "01/02" }}
{{ else }}
    {{ .Format "2006/01/02" }}
{{ end }}
#+end_src

Note the =$=. That basically means to get the parent / global?? scratch object. Otherwise =.Scratch= alone would reference the scratch from the partial's current environment.
