#+title: Fallback templates

This is the fallback templates folder.

Single pages use =single.html=, list pages use =list.html=.

Everything goes back to =baseof.html=.

If a page has a =layout= set, it'll use the template for that layout instead. For instance, [[../../content/about.org][about.org]] uses the =about.html= template here because it has set its =#+layout= to =about=.

Section rules still apply. covers/abc.org with a layout of =test= will check templates/covers/test.html first.

See [[https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order][here]] for many examples for the lookup order.
