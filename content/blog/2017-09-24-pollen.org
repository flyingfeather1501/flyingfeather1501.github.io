So, I restructured this blog again, this time using ◊link["https://mstill.io"]{mstill.io} as a template, because I don't know how to use bootstrap. And I want to use Pollen markup.

The process is actually suprisingly smooth, except:

◊ul{
◊li{Post date isn't updating. I have to fix it.}
◊li{There's no Atom / RSS feed ready to use, I'll have to maybe do it myself.}
}

Overall I like this setup a bit more.

◊em{Update: The not updating date was just me hard-coding the date during testing, then forgetting it there.}
