#+title: UTAU Covers

One of my hobbies.

Items that say =<FILL>= are information that I haven't inserted yet.

I still have to fill in links to the originals.

Note to self:

1. modify code in =2021-05-21T20:34:46+0900= to extract saved original links
2. fill in others manually in each entry
3. make sure the author text links to the originals
