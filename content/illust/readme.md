# Illustration entries

Each page here represents an illustration work, ie those that I post to Pixiv.

Filename is just the title (might be subject to change). Don’t put the date in the filename.

Frontmatter:
- title
- date (full ISO 8601 string)
- (maybe) tags
- (maybe) `roam_tags` for easier retrieval as part of my notes

Each page should also at least show the image itself.

I haven’t figured out where to host them. I have a central place for them (kind of) in my private datastore, but for a public place I’m not sure.

This file is excluded from being rendered by Hugo.
