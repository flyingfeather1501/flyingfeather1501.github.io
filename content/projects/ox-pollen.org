#+title: ox-pollen

* ox-pollen

ox-pollen allows exporting Org mode to Pollen markup.

The Pollen markup it generates is somewhat opinionated, simply because of how flexible Pollen markup is.

It supports converting Org mode keywords (=#+title:= and the like) to =define-meta= statements.

Combined with Make, it makes for a pretty nice workflow for writing pages in Org in a Pollen project.
