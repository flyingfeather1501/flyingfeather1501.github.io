#+title: Subscribing to the RSS / ATOM feed

ATOM is a standard for subscribing to web content. (RSS is its predecessor.)

Think a Youtube account that you use to subscribe to Youtube channels. Each ATOM feed is like a channel, and your “RSS reader” of choice is your subscription feed. Although, unlike on Youtube, you have to manually add the URL into your reader to subscribe[fn:1].

If you don’t have a reader, [[https://feedly.com/][Feedly]] and [[https://www.inoreader.com/][Inoreader]] are pretty okay.

The feed to this blog is here: [[/index.xml]]

[fn:1]: Firefox used to display a summary of the feed and a button to add it to some readers when visiting a feed; however, it has been removed.
