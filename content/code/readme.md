# Code project listing

I treat project types as being distinct. Nobody wants to see an UTAU cover and https://aqi.tw shown in the same list, side-by-side.

I don’t think I’m overdoing it. eg. 2dcg and 3dcg are not split.

Frontmatter:

- title
- status (WIP, abandoned, etc.)
- tags

We also need to have a set list of status tags.

Maybe include an image thumbnail?

Existing files in projects/ will eventually be transferred over here.
