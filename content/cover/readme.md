# Cover project listing

UTAU covers and maybe my own cover experiment.

Frontmatter:

- song title
- vb name
- date
- tags

~~Title, original credit, and VB should somehow all be listed in the article title in a consistent way. It doesn’t have to be consistent on Youtube or niconico because they’re also serving as a hook, but here I want them to just be as consise as possible. I guess.~~

We can list them in individual fields, then display them like:

| title         | orig | vb     |
| ------------- | ---- | ------ |
| M.S.S.Phantom | MSSP | 夏語遙 |

in the listing, and like

```text
M.S.S.Phantom / 夏語遙
original: MSSP
```

Add embeds and links as needed. Embed from niconico unless that doesn’t work well.
