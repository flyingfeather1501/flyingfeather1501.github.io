* Tags

A tag or a category is what's called a /Taxonomy/.

The hierarchy goes like this:

- /Taxonomies/
  - Categories
  - Tags
    - UTAU
    - Emacs
      - page
      - another page

More accurately, tags and categories are /taxonomy lists/, while individual items (eg. the =emacs= tag) are /taxonomy terms/. Both of them are lists as they contain other pages.

As taxonomy terms are lists, their corresponding source files are located in =<taxonomy>/<term>/_index.<ext>=, instead of at =<type>/<term>.<ext>=.

This doesn't actually work yet. I haven't figured it out.

* Casing

As I specify tags in title case in posts, the tags are in title case.
