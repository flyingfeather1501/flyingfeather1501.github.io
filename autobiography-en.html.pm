◊h1{About me: Kisaragi Hiu}

◊topic{Past.}

I'm Kevin Shen, or Kisaragi Hiu, a 17-year-old third-grader in ◊|slhs|.

I was born on February 28, 2000. According to my parents, I actually started memorizing the English alphabet before learning Bopomofo — just a trivia, not really an indicator for any sort of English skills.

My parents sent me to a dual-language kindergarten when I was 3, where I received most of my early English education. Later the kindergarten course extended into elementary school, further driving most of my English learning of the period.

◊subtopic{Elementary school}

I attended ◊link["http://www.tzes.tp.edu.tw/"]{Taipei Municipal Da Zhi Elementary School} for my primary education. During this time, I spent most of my time getting good grades, and occasionally play a few video games. I was also very active, playing tag with friends every break between classes.

During grade 6, my class participated in the Taipei City Elementary School Sports Contest (台北市小學運動會) and got third place in relay. (◊link["http://www.tzes.tp.edu.tw/news/u_news_v2.asp?id={FB2A7A2C-1C2E-345E-CD1E-7282D247C435}&newsid=3480&PageNo=45&skeyword="]{Announcement from TZES on 2012/03/07.}) I was a backup runner, and practiced with the team, though I wasn't running fast enough to join the final race.

I graduated in June 2012.

I joined ◊|dcsh| in September.
During grade 7, I started having an interest in installing custom ROMs on my Android phone, which grew into an interest in Linux a few months later. I started my Linux journey with Ubuntu, installing it on an unused computer at home, and learned a lot more about computers when using it. Around March 2013, I also started reading books on the writer ◊link["http://seba.tw"]{Seba's blog}, and I still read quite a lot to this day. I also played Minecraft for a bit, at one point trying (and failing) to create a custom game map in it.

Fun trivia, my main email ◊code{kevinshencm10@gmail.com} was created during this period when I successfully installed CyanogenMod 10 on my Xperia Arc S for the first time.

I got a laptop from my family in October 2013, and immediately installed ◊eos on it. After that was my time of rapid Linux exploration.

I got into ◊osu in February 2014, and have been playing since.

I started a niconico account around April 2013, and got hooked onto the indie music scene on the platform. As a result, I got really interested in Japanese, and told myself to try to learn Japanese in four years, as an experiment to see how far I can go. It has been going really well: without taking any actual courses, I think I'm at about JLPT N3 level, able to read less complicated novels and comics like ◊|hoshinonamida|.

In grade 9, I started learning a vocal synthesizer platform called ◊link["http://utau2008.web.fc2.com/"]{UTAU}, and covered a few songs with it. I also started learning ◊link["https://www.blender.org/"]{Blender} around April 2014, and have finished a few renders with it.

I publish my covers on ◊youtube["channel/UCl_hsqcvdX0XdgBimRQ6R3A" #:use-ref? #f]{Youtube} and ◊niconico["user/38995186" #:use-ref? #f]{niconico}, and my renders, sketches, etc. on ◊pixiv["member.php?id=14235181" #:use-ref? #f]{Pixiv}.

I joined ◊|slhs| in 2015, majoring in the Applied Foreign Language (English) department, with the goal of advancing my English skills.

I've translated a few projects in senior high so far. I am the main (only, actually) Chinese (Taiwan) translator for ◊link["https://easyrpg.org/"]{EasyRPG Player}, as you can see on ◊transifex["FlyingFeather" #:use-ref? #f]{my Transifex profile}, and one of the three Traditional Chinese translators for ◊github["naseweis520/osu-Sync"]{osu!Sync}, a tool for managing ◊osuwiki["Beatmaps"]{osu! beatmaps}.

In July 2016, I started looking into programming, and made a Bash script called ◊github["flyingfeather1501/randomwallpaper"]{randomwallpaper} for slideshow wallpaper on some desktops that don't support it. I have since then written a few small shell utilities to automate my life a little bit better, like ◊code{markdown-furigana} which is a quick hack to replace all occurrences of ◊code{{{text:ruby}}} with html tags for ◊ruby{ruby◊rt{this}}.

All this time I've been playing ◊osu once in a while, but in March 2017 I decided to practice it a bit more as well to learn more about this process. I also want to create a ◊osuwiki["Skin"]{osu! skin}, so after a few months of work, I now have a hacked-together osu! skin builder, ◊github["flyingfeather1501/mkosuskin.sh"]{mkosuskin.sh}, for turning a bunch of Blender, LMMS, and Inkscape project files into a zip file that osu! accepts as a skin.

After thinking about it since when I was 11 or so, I started practicing singing in February 2017. I have now practiced and even uploaded a few covers onto my youtube channel (though they're very rough around the edges). Currently I plan to join the school singing competetion in September and see how it goes.

Right now, I have the ability to:
･Translate English ↔ Mandarin, Japanese → English
･Do basic programming (◊github["flyingfeather1501" #:use-ref? #f]{See for yourself.})
･Blender

◊topic{Future.}
◊;notes{What do I want?
◊;I want to perfect my Japanese.
◊;I want to be a developer. Maybe Racket, maybe something to do with osu!, I dunno.
◊;I want to be good at singing, Blender, drawing, and just generally creating stuff.
◊;I want to create stories.}
My dream is to be a freelancer, in full control of my financial situation, and have a sustainable income. In order to achieve that, some actual skills are definitely needed, and that's what I'm currently doing.

In addition to that, I also want to be an artist.

I want to be able to sing well. I want to be producing stories. I want to create astonishing virtual environments. I want to be able to read in as many languages I feel like learning. I want to be a programmer, solving people's problems. I want to be able to jump around fields as I will.

First step to that is definitely learning the skills, and learning "learning" itself. I have to optimize my learning process. If I learn something, I want to actually understand what's going on to some degree.

After that, it'll be about mixing my skills to create my own future. That's also meaning I put into the name Kisaragi Hiu: ◊code{"To shine like the Moon, to fly like a feather."}

◊;notes{(Or at least that's what I intended. 5 years after its creation, I can definitely see where it's a bit silly. What does "fly like a feather" even mean?)}
